# Robust Plant Identification Using Hierarchical Taxonomic Information

## Overview
This project introduces a novel loss function that leverages hierarchical taxonomic relationships among plant families, genera, and species to improve plant identification. The proposed method addresses the challenge of high intra-species variation and inter-species similarity by incorporating taxonomic information and multiple observed images in the identification process.

## Motivation
Plant identification is a challenging task, especially for novice botanists, due to the fine-grained differences between species within the same genus or family. Traditional methods often rely on single-image classification, which may not fully capture taxonomic relationships or the variations across multiple observations of a plant. To enhance identification accuracy, we propose a deep learning approach that integrates taxonomic constraints and multi-image fusion.

## Key Contributions
- **Hierarchical Taxonomic Loss**: Defines specialized loss functions to capture the relationships within plant taxonomy, enhancing species, genus, and family-level identification.
- **Deep Learning Backbone Integration**: Implements the loss functions with various deep learning architectures for robust classification.
- **Multi-Image Fusion**: Utilizes late fusion techniques to combine classification results from multiple images of a plant for improved accuracy.
- **Empirical Validation**: Conducts extensive experiments on the **VietForest** dataset, which contains 156 species from Phu Tho province, Vietnam.

## Experimental Results
The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the **VietForest** dataset:
- **Single-image identification**:
  - Family: **84.88%**
  - Genus: **82.26%**
  - Species: **81.14%**
- **Multi-image identification (5 images)**:
  - Family: **97.45%**
  - Genus: **91.77%**
  - Species: **89.35%**

## Dataset
**VietForest** is a dataset collected for plant species identification in Phu Tho province, Vietnam. It contains labeled images across 156 species, ensuring a diverse and representative benchmark for evaluating plant identification models.
